Plan: associate each DSF formula with a representative emoji...

possible_pairs = [
    G G
    G O
    G W
    G S

    O G
    O O
    O W
    O S

    W G
    W O
    W W
    W S

    S G
    S O
    S W
    S S
];

Numbers: quite a few combinations

4^2 = 16 possible pairs for relation (R)
16*5 = 80 possible pairs with 5 predicates

Some combinations are redundant (e.g., W/W = W,  S + O = {} )

So real n < 80

Emojis: examples might include...

emojis = [
    gas_only = 🔳;
    liquid_foam = 🍺;
    solid_foam = 🍞;
    oil_only = 🛢;
    aerosol = ☁;
    water_oil = 🧈;
    oil_water = 🥛;
    water_only = 🍷;
    gel_stat = 🧀;
    gel_dyna = 🥝;
    solid_only = 🧊;
    solid_bulk = 🧂;

]

Examples:

W/W = 🍷 (water only as ethanol is not dissolved rather than suspended)
W/S = 🧀 (a gel such as cheese, with water dispersed in a solid matrix)
w/s/w = 🧀/🍷 (gelled particles dispersed in a an aqueous dispersant)
