Idea 1: associate each DSF formula with a representative emoji...

possible_pairs = [
    G / G = 🔳;
    G / O = 🍺;
    G / W = 🍺;
    G / S = 🍞;

    O / G = ☁;
    O / O = 🛢;
    O / W = 🥛;
    O / S = 🥑;

    W / G = ☁;
    W / O = 🧈;
    W / W = 🍷;
    W / S = 🧀;

    S / G = 🧂;
    S / O = 🏺🥗;
    S / W = 🧃;
    S / S = 🍪;
];

4^2 = 16 possible pairs for relation (R)
16*5 = 80 possible pairs with 5 predicates

Some combinations are redundant (e.g., W/W = W,  S + O = {} )

So real n < 80

Combining emojis...

W/W = 🍷 (water only as ethanol is not dissolved rather than suspended)
W/S = 🧀 (a gel such as cheese, with water dispersed in a solid matrix)
W/S/W = 🧀/🍷 (gelled particles dispersed in a an aqueous dispersant)

Idea 2: formulae trigger information around procedures, nutrition and/or flavour

result: O/W
recommendation: to dissolve oil in water a surfactant is often needed
nutrition: the presence of oil and water phases allow both vitamin C and D to be added
flavour: extract spices in the oil and dissolver sugars in the water before mixing

Idea 3: disambiguate formulae

result: G+O/W
disambiguate: /+GOW
meaning: gas in addition to oil both dispersed in water

result: G+O @ S/W
disambiguate: @+GO/SW
meaning: gas in addition to oil included within a solid in water dispersion
